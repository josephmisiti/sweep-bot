# Sweep

Sweep is a Github assistant bot that completes tickets by making a PR and responds to PR comments.

## Story

We were frustrated by small tickets such simple bug fixes, annoying refactors and small features and realized ChatGPT/GPT-4 could easily do it. Unlike copilot, this can solve entire tickets and can be parallelized: someone can spin up 10 tickets and have it solve them all at once. Unfortunately, Github released much of the same features recently and we decided to call it cuts for this project.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install poetry using `pip install poetry`
3. Install the dependencies using `poetry install`
4. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file. You will need to set the following variables:
    - `BOT_TOKEN`: Your Github bot token
    - `OPENAI_SECRET`: Your OpenAI API secret key
5. Run the bot using `modal serve src/api.py` and add the endpoint URL to the repo webhooks.

## Tools
- Modal
- OpenAI
- PyGithub

## Usage

Once the bot is running, it will listen for new issues by creating a PR and will respond to PR comments, being aware of the line numbers.
